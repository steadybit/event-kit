# Steadybit EventKit

EventKit allows extensions to consume events from the Steadybit platform to integrate with third-party systems. Extensions leveraging EventKit are similar to webhooks but do not face the typical web routing issues as Steadybit agents handle this aspect. You can use EventKit to:

 - Add markers to monitoring systems' charts during experiment executions.
 - Capture experiment execution statistics.
 - Report information about experiment executions to Slack, Discord etc.

## Getting Started

We recommend that you read the following documentation to get started with EventKit.

 - [Event API](/docs/event-api.md)
 - [Event Registration](/docs/event-registration.md)
 - [Terminology](/docs/terminology.md)
