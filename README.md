# Steadybit EventKit

The Steadybit EventKit enables the extension of Steadybit with new event listener capabilities. For example, EventKit can be used to author open/closed source:

- notify listeners and other systems about started / ended experiments and their meta data

At this moment, EventKit can be considered an **open-beta**. The contracts and APIs *may* change. If you want to learn more, [reach out to us](https://www.steadybit.com/contact).
