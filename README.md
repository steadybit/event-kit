# Steadybit EventKit

EventKit allows extensions to consume events from the Steadybit platform to integrate with third-party systems. Extensions leveraging EventKit are similar to webhooks but do not face the typical web routing issues as Steadybit agents handle this aspect. You can use EventKit to:

 - Forward audit logs to an external system.
 - Add markers to monitoring systems' charts during experiment executions.
 - Capture experiment execution statistics.
 - Report information about experiment executions to Slack, Discord etc.


At this moment, EventKit can be considered an **open-beta**. The contracts and APIs *may* change. If you want to learn more, [reach out to us](https://www.steadybit.com/contact).

We recommend that you read the following documentation to get started with EventKit.

 - [Event API](/docs/event-api.md)
 - [Event Registration](/docs/event-registration.md)
